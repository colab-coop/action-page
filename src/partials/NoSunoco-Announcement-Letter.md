NoSunoco.com was created to call for a boycott of Sunoco, the primary company responsible for the attacks on the land and people of Standing Rock in the name of oil profits. 

This holiday season, let's refuse to let our time with those we love be fueled by violence and environmental desecration.  Don't buy gas or patronize  Sunoco or any of its partner companies Speedway, Suncor, or Stripes. 

Sunoco and its partner Energy Transfer Partners are investing billions in the Dakota Access Pipeline and are responsible for its route through sacred lands and the violent attacks on the water protectors. The water protectors are fighting bravely and inspirationally for the sacredness of their land, the safety of their water and for their right to self-determination. They are fighting for us all, in the face of militarized police forces, armed thugs, and the ravenous force of extractive industries.

For too long these companies have escaped accountability for their actions. That ends here. That ends now.

* **No Sunoco** till the violence at Standing Rock has stopped.
* **No Sunoco** till they have halted illegal digging and destruction of the Standing Rock land and burial grounds.
* **No Sunoco** till they have called off the DAPL and commited to reaching a agreement with the Standing Rock Sioux and all affected peoples.

No more attacks. No more environmental destruction. No more wreckless oil profiteering.

This holiday season say "No Sunoco!"
