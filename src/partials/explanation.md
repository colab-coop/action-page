## Sunoco and its parent company Energy Transfer Partners have secured **over $6 billion in credit toward construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline**.

Because of Sunoco and its partners:

* Water protectors and members of the Standing Rock Sioux have been harassed,
  beaten and attacked.
* Drilling has already begun, disrespecting the Standing Rock Sioux and violating
  treaties.
* People and ecosystems from the Dakotas to the Mississippi are at risk.

These companies have spent too long in the shadows.

It's time to hold all the DAPL companies accountable for their actions and
the violence being undertaken on their behalf. Boycott Sunoco, Suncor, Speedway,
Stripes, their partner companies and the banks who are backing them.

For more information on the financial backers of the DAPL see [this

**UPDATE**: Sunoco will be [acquiring and merging with ETP][etp-sunoco-merger]
in 2017 for $20 billion!.

Make sure the world knows the truth about Sunoco and the companies behind the
attacks at Standing Rock. Spread the word about the boycott.
