## HOW DOES IT WORK?

Action-Page uses Gulp to assemble content that's mostly in Markdown format (some
is in Pug/Jade or HTML). All CSS is written using CSS3 standards, compiled using
the awesome PostCSS-CSSNext library. Gulp is also used to deploy the code to
Amazon S3 and clear any CloudFront caches on update.

All account IDs, images, etc. can be updated using variables in the config.js
file or the variables.css css file.

Super-easy!

## CAN I GET INVOLVED?

YES! Action-Page is a newborn open source project and we'd love improvement
ideas, bug reports and, especially, PRs via GitHub.
