## HOW DOES IT WORK?

Action-Page uses Gulp to assemble responsive action pages from content that's
mostly in Markdown format (some is in Pug/Jade or HTML). All CSS is written
using CSS3 standards, compiled using the awesome PostCSS-CSSNext library. Gulp
is also used to deploy the code to Amazon S3 and clear any CloudFront caches on
update.

All account IDs, images, etc. can be updated using variables in the config.js
file or the variables.css css file. You can add support for styled Action Network
signup forms, customized share buttons, and more by enabling each section in the
config file.

It's super easy! For more details, check out the

## CAN I GET INVOLVED?

YES! Action-Page is a newborn open source project and we'd love improvement
ideas, bug reports and, especially, PRs via GitHub.
